## Project Overview
The project is divided into part of Frontend and Backend. 

Frontend is a collection of static subpages with original CSS/JavaScript animations. He communicates with the server part through the REST API.
One of the problems I faced was the creation of planets' trading animation in the solar system. This effect was achieved thanks to mathematical functions.

I visualized climate data on the charts. I used for this library chart.js

Backend was written using Node.js and Express Framework. I download data from an external API, which is then stored in MontoDb.
